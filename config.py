# ─── Chunking (Milestone 3) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# campus_life's real chunking strategy is paragraph splitting — see
# chunker.py::split_documents. These two numbers are only a safety cap for a
# heading+paragraph pair that runs unexpectedly long; the longest one this
# corpus actually produces is 397 characters, well under 500.

CHUNK_SIZE = 500        # characters per chunk, safety cap only
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 80      # characters shared between neighbouring chunks, if the cap ever triggers


# ─── Retrieval (Milestone 4) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

# 5 chunks average 167 characters each on this corpus (see chunker.py), so
# even top-5 is compact context. Confirmed against the one close case this
# corpus produces: CS 210 vs. its CS 340 lookalike, where the right chunk
# ranks 3rd — 5 leaves margin above that.
TOP_K = 5               # how many chunks to pull back per question

# The relevance gate. If the best chunk is further away than this, the system
# refuses to answer instead of handing the model thin material.
#
# LOWER IS BETTER: 0.3 is a close match, 0.9 is unrelated.
#
# Measured, not just kept at the default: my 5 in-corpus test questions best
# out at 0.123-0.441; the 5 OUT_OF_SCOPE questions best out at 0.787-0.923.
# That's a wide, clean gap, and 0.6 sits almost exactly in its middle. See
# README.md's Sample Answer section for the full ten-question table.
THRESHOLD = 0.6


# ─── Models ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Embeddings run on your own machine and cost no API quota.
# Only generation calls out to a service.

# This is the model Chroma bundles, and leaving it alone is the fast path: it
# downloads about 80 MB from Chroma's own CDN and needs nothing else installed.
#
# Setting it to any other name — week 2's "try a second embedding model"
# stretch option — switches to loading that model from Hugging Face instead,
# which needs `pip install 'sentence-transformers>=3.4,<3.5'` first. store.py
# says so with a real error message rather than a stack trace if you forget.

# you a warning instead of your whole day's allowance.

    Chroma is fussy about collection names: 3 to 63 characters, starting and
    ending with a letter or digit, and nothing but letters, digits, underscores
    and hyphens in between. If you bring your own corpus and name the folder
    something Chroma won't accept, this cleans it up rather than failing.
